h1. Background

The rule of thirds and the five basic shots provide a great foundation to start making your shots better with. They’re not the only rules to learn however. Nose space and Head space are two important rules that will help you arrange the rest of the space in your frame to support your story.

h1. Solution

h2. Nose Space

Well composed shots have space in the direction the subject is facing, or moving.

<hr/>

In this medium shot, the subject is on the right rule of third line. He is facing the left hand side of the frame. You can see, the direction he is facing is where the remaining two thirds of the frame are.

<hr/>

If he was facing the opposite direction you could either ask him to shift the direction he is facing and follow the same example, or adjust your frame and your frame would look like this.

You can see, everything is framed on the right, now that he is facing the opposite direction.

Following this guideline will ensure your subject has appropriate room in front of them. You may also hear this rule referred to as “looking space” or “lead room”. It’s the same concept though.

h2. Head Space

Head space is the distance between the top of a subject’s head, and the top of the frame. It is a guideline to make sure your subjects head does not appear to high or too low in the frame.

This amount of space changes depending on what shot size you are using. 

These three different shots all have very different head room. But in all of them the focal point of the subject rests on the top line. This means headspace is really a balance of the rule of thirds and the top of the frame.

<hr/>

You should always keep these rules in mind to effectively use the space in your frame. Follow these rules to keep your audience focused on the story.

!5.10.9.a.png(Example of bad nose space)!

If you do not allow for nose space, your subject may appear to be speaking to someone else.

In general, if you do not follow this rule your subject appears cramped in the frame, and the audience will be distracted.

)

If you do not allow for proper headspace your subject’s head will be cut off, or their head will sit very low in the frame. Both of these are very distracting to an audience as well.
