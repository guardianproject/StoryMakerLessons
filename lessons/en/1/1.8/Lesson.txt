h1. Problem Statement

h2. The Arab region is today experiencing a profound change in its media. You are at the core of a transition that has resulted in more democratic governments and greater media freedom in several countries and various stages of transition in others. Yet media law in the region remains weak at best and at worst has been used as a tool to silence journalists. How should you navigate the ongoing change in media law?

h1. Background

Journalists everywhere work under at least some small degree of legal restrictions over what they produce. Most commonly these are issues of national security, information deemed to be obscene and language that might incite violence or put people in danger.

In countries with well-developed media laws, criticism of government and presentation of unpopular ideas is permitted. Some degree of public access to government records is also guaranteed.

Several countries in the Middle East are now drafting new media laws as they overhaul their constitutions. Advocacy organizations such as the Committee to Protect Journalists are concerned vague language in emerging laws may be used against journalists.

h3. Know the law

Understand the law in the country or region you work. Just because laws to protect journalists exist does not mean that government, local leadership and security forces will obey the law, but understanding the law can be a first step toward improving it.

h3. Adhere to professional codes of conduct

In an earlier lesson there is a professional code of conduct for journalists. Even in countries where media laws are very restrictive, observing the principles outlined may help you avoid accusations of libel or treason.

h3. Advocate for change

One of the key characteristics of the shift in media throughout the Arab region is the blending of media with media advocacy. Citizen journalists are breaking through barriers in how journalism is defined at the same time they are covering stories. Pool resources with others to create a knowledge base. Seek support from legal organizations within your country. Seek support and information from international organizations like the Committee to
Protect Journalists.

h3. Protect yourself (and your sources)

This issue will be addressed more fully in the digital security module. In short, understanding the law, how authorities may ignore or abuse the law or identify you online and being proactive is essential to any journalist working under unsafe conditions. If you are arrested, prosecuted or harassed, contact national and international organizations that provide support for journalists.

h1. Things to Remember

Inevitably the development of media law in the Arab region and in individual countries will reflect their unique cultures and national interests. Nonetheless, you have to be willing to push boundaries. Even in many countries with fairly liberal laws self-censorship is an issue among journalists. Some journalists are uncomfortable covering highly controversial cultural issues such as the rights of women or tribal disputes. Some journalists are reluctant to cover issues that tarnish national image such as widespread alcohol abuse or corruption within popular institutions. Sunshine is the best disinfectant. If these issues have relevance to the public interest, people need to know and it is your job to tell them.
