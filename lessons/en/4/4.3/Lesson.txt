Every photograph needs a caption and keywords/tags. A good caption provides the reader basic information and context to understand a photograph and its relevance to the news: where the photo was taken, when it was taken, and a very brief description of what's in the photo. Search engines and search fields on sites like YouTube can't recognize images. They can only recognize text associated with the image. Keywords and tags, along with the caption, help viewers find the images through search engines.

Captions should be clear, accurate and complete in the information they provide about the photograph.

The captions for a photo essay should not repeat the same information over and over. Write captions as short, progressive explanations of the individual image in the context of the entire slideshow. In some cases you may present them as title cards that present short “factoids,” additional information or stats that help provide context.

h1. Solution

h2. Writing Captions

A caption should be one or two sentences. In most photo captions the first sentence identifies the people and location of the photograph and date where it was taken. The second should provide contextual information to help readers understand what they are looking at.

h3. Example of How to Write a Caption:

The first sentence should:

* Be written in the present tense.
* Be written in complete sentences
* Describe What’s in the picture
* Say exactly when it was taken
* Say Exactly where it was taken


A second or sometimes third sentence should:

* Typically be written in the past tense
* Be written in complete sentences
* Provide context to allow viewers to better understand the significance of the image.

EXAMPLE: 
A child severely burned by a car bomb on June 9, 2010, receives care at the Indira Gandi Institute of Child Medicine in Kabul, Afghanistan. Doctors are struggling with limited medicines to treat the growing number of child victims whose injuries are often compounded by other medical problems, such as poor nutrition, that diminish a child's ability to heal.

The exact format for captions vary, but a basic photo captions should:

* Clearly identify the people and location in the photo. Professional titles should be included and the formal name of the location. In large groups, identifications of only notable people may be required and sometimes no I.D.s are required at all.
* Include the date the photograph was taken. If an archive photograph or photograph taken prior to the event is used, the caption should make it clear that it is a “file photo.”
* Provide some context or background to the reader so he or she can understand the news value of the photograph.

h2. Keywords and Tags

!11.jpg(Tags: tank, Russian Afghanistan. This image is licensed to be reproduce commercially.)!

Keywords and tags help search engines find images and work identify photos in the archive. Typically there will be a field for keywords or tags along with the caption field.

<hr/>

TIPS

* Include specific geographic information.
* Avoid abbreviations.
* Keyword with the kind of photo(s) it is (portrait, demonstration, economy).
* Consider word choice: Would someone use another word more naturally to do a search?
* Think about related words to your topic that might help direct people to your photo.
* Use common words that reflect specific subjects: Computer security: hacking, hackers, security, firewall, attack, network, flaw.
* Order of the keywords/tags is important-with the first couple of words weighed more heavily.

h1. Things to Remember

Basic caption and keywords should always be included. Here are some things to watch out for:

* Make sure names of people and places are correctly identified and spelled.
* Be accurate.
* Photojournalism is journalism.
* If a photo is manipulated digitally beyond simple sizing and color control, it should be labeled as a “photo illustration” in the caption or in the photo credit. If unusual photo techniques are used, such as high dynamic range (HDR) effects, it should be noted in the caption.
* Do not editorialize or make assumptions about what someone in a picture is thinking: “an unhappy voter...” or “A fortunate survivor...” The reader should be given the facts and allowed to decide for herself or himself what the feelings or emotions are.
* Do not characterize the content of a picture as beautiful, dramatic, horrifying or in any other such descriptive terms that should be evident in the photograph. If it's not evident in the photograph, you telling the reader won't make it happen.
