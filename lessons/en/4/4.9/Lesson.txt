Your eye in combination with your brain does an excellent job of calibrating how you perceive color. You will recognize a color as red even if the light source illuminating it is very yellow, making the apparent color orange. You will recognize fleshtones even if the light illuminating the subject is a very greenish-blue fluorescent.

A digital camera can’t do that. It has to be calibrated to adjust for different light source’s color temperature. This calibration is measured against absolute white. That’s why it is called white balance.

Small tungsten bulbs have a very warm temperature, coloring the image more yellow. Daylight on an overcast, cloudy day has a very high light temperature coloring the image blue. Other light sources -- sunlight, fluorescent light, shade -- all fall in the middle. Color temperature has nothing to do with the amount of light.

Good color management is very important. It makes image much more professional in appearance. dSLRs and many point-and-shoots will allow you calibrate the white balance manually. Many smartphones provide a variety of presets for white balance.

If your camera allows you to set the white balance manually, do it. Your smartphone may have a button or menu option for white balance. It will offer several icons representing- five or six- common light sources. Pick the one that most represents the shooting conditions you are working under.

If your smartphone cannot control white balance manually, you can correct color with post-production apps (for more on this, see the section on post-production). If the color temperature is way off, it is VERY IMPORTANT to make adjustments before publishing your images.

h1. Things to Remember

h2. AWB (Auto White Balance)

!9.png(A common Auto White Balance icon)!

Used for shooting anywhere. Camera does its best to guess what the right setting should be. Can provide poor results if camera guesses wrong. This is the setting you should use if you’re unsure of which of these is the best to go with.

h2. Daylight

Used for shooting outdoors. This setting will give your images a very “cool” or a slight blue tint to them. When shooting indoors, images will have an orange tint.

<hr/>

h2. Cloudy

Used for shooting outdoors. This setting will give your images a slightly “warmer” color to them. While the daylight option is technically the more correct white balance, using the cloudy setting gives a very appealing image.

When shooting indoors, this setting will give your images a strong orange tint.

h2. Incandescent

h2. Fluorescent

For shooting indoors, with the long tube fluorescent lights. When shooting outdoors, images will have a blue tint.
