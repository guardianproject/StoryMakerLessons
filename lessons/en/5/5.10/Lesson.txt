A series of shots assembled together is a sequence. When made up of shots that support each other, an individual sequence can tell a complete story. Each sequence of five shots makes a complete scene.

h1. Solution

To shoot for a sequence you need to break down each story element into individual parts. It may be a small number of parts, or it may be many. You need to know all the parts before you can put the sequence together correctly.

Let's walk through an example. You are filming a story on a popular fruit stand. You want to show someone buying fruit.

We will need to see a person who will be buying the fruit.

As a sequence of three shots in that order it tells a simple, but complete story.

Knowing your story gives you the freedom to record your shots in any order. In the end, you will assemble them to tell your story.

These shots are the beginning, middle, and end of your story. There is a person, there is a piece of fruit, the person paid for the fruit. It is a very simple story, but it works. You can now add an interview, with the seller or buyer of the fruit. You might also include a wide shot to define the location.

When you are shooting for your sequences, keep your head in the story and you will be able to tell yourself what shots you still need.

No matter how complex your story gets, remember to shoot in three parts, beginning, middle, and end. Each of these may have multiple shots, with different elements in the frame. As a whole, your shots must add up to a sequence that includes all three parts. In some stories you have an entire 5 shot scene(or more!) for each section of the story.

A popular technique to use when you might not know the story you are telling is to start with shots that are farther away, working your way into a scene shot by shot. If you record your shots in chronological order they will have a feeling of progression to them. By using the five basic shots, you will be able to include different elements of your scene.

h1. Things to Remember

* Any successful sequence will answer the six important questions we have previously discussed. (The who, what, where, when, why, and the how.)
* Each question can have more than one answer, but your sequence should answer each question in order to be successful.
* Creating an effective sequence means shooting different sized shots each containing complementary parts of the story.
* When you bring several sequences together, you make a more complex story.
